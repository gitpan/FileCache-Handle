NAME
    FileCache::Handle - A FileCache using IO::Handle instances

SYNOPSIS
      use FileCache::Handle;

      $FileCache::Handle::MAX = 16;

      my @a;
      for (my $i = 0 ; $i < 100 ; $i++) {
        my $o = new FileCache::Handle("/tmp/$i");

        binmode($o, ':utf8');
        push @a, $o;
      }

      for (my $i = 0 ; $i < 3 ; $i++) {
        foreach my $o (@a) {
          print $o "Output ",$o," $i\n";
        }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    FileCache::Handle, like FileCache, avoids OS-imposed limits on the
    number of simultaneously open files. Instances behave like file handles
    and, behind the scenes, real files are opened and closed as necessary.
    FileCache::Handle uses instances of IO::Handle, and so works well with
    'use strict'.

NOTES
    The only operations supported are 'print' and 'binmode'. To add more,
    create a glue method that delegates the call to the handle returned by
    '_allocate()'.
